It is February of 2018 and I finally decided to adventure on my own. Take all my experience in different aspects and start building my own brand and doing something that I think it will be the best for me in my future.

I decided to do an application going on a somewhat niche market and it mixes some ideas of everything that I have experienced.

For the first phase I am actually considering my data storage. The question would be _why?_ 

The answer lies on how I'm planning to market the product as. I've had experience using most major database vendors. From Microsoft SQL Server to Neo4J to MongoDB. I feel that the best approach does not lie in using a single tool. We as software developers tend to use our favorite tool or the ones that we can do the best work, but sometimes we have to pick what is best for the job and sometimes we just have to settle for what is in between both.

For the initial prototype I will be using a Laravel + Neo4J combination. Laravel is a very powerful backend system that is extendable and has a great community. While I did mention backend and not front end the fact is that it is very easily extensible to both. I will be running on an extremely low budget setup for starters and this combination will allow me to scale easily.

Another plus I that I already own a Spark license I'm not using so extending to a Team or SAAS model will be easier.

The idea is capitalizing on a niche market and be able to pivot to something bigger or smaller. Be able to cater to vendors, wholesalers or single users as demand shifts.

Now the first thing that might change **everything** is the fact that I need image recognition to some degree. I don't need anything too fancy, but if PHP does not cooperate to much on this department I might have to shift to Java, Python or .NET. The good news is that Neo4J has native connectors for all 4 languages. The bad news is well everything else.

First phase will be doing research and very simple tests to see if this can be achieved. If not, well... time for Plan B.
